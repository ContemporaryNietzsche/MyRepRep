RepositoryMadeForRcosHowToWebsite
The "how-to-website" project is an RCOS project were we learn how-to-website. With this project I aim to learn more about html, js, css (and maybe wordpress). Being a CSE major (with a possible dual in cs next semester), I want to learn some web-development and likely become an at least "half-decent" front end developer and I'm giving myself this semester to achieve that.
